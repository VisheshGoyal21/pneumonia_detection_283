Pneumonia is a respiratory infection that can be brought on by bacteria or viruses. It affects a lot of people, especially in developing and impoverished countries where there is a lot of pollution, unclean living conditions, and overcrowding, as well as poor medical facilities. Pleural effusion is a condition where fluids fill the lung and make breathing difficult. It is brought on by pneumonia. To ensure effective treatment and boost survival chances, pneumonia must be diagnosed as soon as possible. The most used technique for diagnosing pneumonia is chest X-ray imaging. However, examining chest X-rays might be difficult and sensitive to subjective variability. Using chest X-ray pictures, we created a computer aided diagnosis method in this work to automatically detect pneumonia.
